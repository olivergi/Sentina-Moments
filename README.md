#Sentina Moments

This is a project for Sentina & Helsinki Metropolia University of applied sciences.

Oliver Gill, Arttu Tiihonen, Liisa Barsk & Teemu RytsÃ¶lÃ¤.

This application is an audio distribution service aimed towards the elderly.
During this application we will be working together with Sentina on a redesign of their existing application:

#https://sentina.savelsirkku.fi/

We have used NPM, bootstrap, moments and angular libraries in our project. 

To serve the application using webpack in terminal use: 

> npm test
